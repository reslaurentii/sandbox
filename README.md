Sandbox project is a collection of simple (and useless) functions to test basic statements of C language.
(if statements, priority, assignment, pointers, array,...)

The code is intentionally cryptic and poorly indented.
The aim is not to write good code, but to see how the code is executed.


It should be useful to prepare an interview about C.

To compile and launch program
```
make clean
make
make run
```

or use

```

make all
```

to execute all with one command.
